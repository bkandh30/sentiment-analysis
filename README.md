# Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains a sentiment analysis project implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook. The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that classifies text data into sentiments such as positive or negative, based on labeled training data.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
├── sentiment_analysis.ipynb
├── train.csv
├── test.csv
└── README.md
```

## 🧠 Features

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopwords removal, etc.)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding dataset distribution
- Model training using scikit-learn (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes)
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk
```

Ensure you also download the required NLTK data (e.g., stopwords):

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis.git](https://github.com/bkandh30/sentiment-analysis.git)
   cd sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook sentiment_analysis.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the notebook to explore the data, preprocess text, train the model, and evaluate performance.

## 📊 Dataset

- `train.csv`: Contains text samples and their corresponding sentiment labels.
- `test.csv`: Contains text samples without labels (used for prediction/inference).

## 📈 Model Evaluation

Evaluation includes:
- Confusion matrix
- Accuracy score
- Classification report
